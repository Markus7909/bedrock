        Up-to-date browsers protect you from viruses, security breaches and hacks. Older versions of browsers may be vulnerable to attacks and security holes. Firefox engineers have been known to ship a security update within a day of learning of a vulnerability.

We believe the Internet is for people, not profit. Unlike other companies, we don’t sell access to your data. You’re in control over who sees your search and browsing history. All that and exceptional performance too.

        Most major browsers update automatically, which means that when a new version is available, your system will download and install it for you. So that’s one less thing you have to worry about keeping on top of. First find out which version of your browser you’re on. Then, if you have your auto update switched off, here’s how to Firefox, Edge, Chrome, Opera or Safari.
